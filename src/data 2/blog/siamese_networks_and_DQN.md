----------------------------------------------------------------------

In Deep Q-Learning (DQN), stability is everything. One of the key tricks to make DQN work is the use of a **target network** ‚Äî a second copy of the Q-function that‚Äôs not updated as frequently. Interestingly, this setup mirrors the structure of **Siamese networks** used in contrastive learning.

## üîÅ The Two Networks in DQN

* **Main Q-network** (parameters $\phi$) ‚Äî the one being trained
* **Target Q-network** (parameters $\phi'$) ‚Äî a frozen or slowly updated version

During training, we use the target network to compute the TD target:

```math
\text{target} = r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\phi'}(s', a')
```

The loss is computed on the main network:

```math
\mathcal{L}(\phi) = \left(Q_\phi(s, a) - \text{target}\right)^2
```

So: one network is providing a **stable reference**, while the other learns.

## üß† Why It Resembles a Siamese Network

Siamese networks involve two (or more) **networks with shared architecture**:

* One is often **frozen** (e.g. momentum encoder in BYOL)
* The other is trainable
* Both process different views and their outputs are aligned or compared

This is almost identical to:

* Main Q-net $Q_\phi$: actively learning
* Target net $Q_{\phi'}$: frozen for stability

‚û°Ô∏è The target network acts as a **frozen twin** ‚Äî just like a Siamese structure.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Are the Networks Updated?

### ‚úÖ Main Q-Network Update

Trained via **gradient descent** on TD loss:

```math
\phi \leftarrow \phi - \alpha \nabla_\phi \mathcal{L}(\phi)
```

This happens **every step** using sampled transitions from the replay buffer.

### üîÅ Target Network Update

There are two main strategies:

#### üü© 1. Hard Update (used in classic DQN)

```math
\phi' \leftarrow \phi \quad \text{(every C steps)}
```

* Simple and widely used
* Sudden change in target, may cause small instability

#### üü® 2. Soft Update (EMA)

```math
\phi' \leftarrow \tau \phi + (1 - \tau) \phi'
```

* $\tau \in (0,1)$, e.g. 0.005
* Smooth change, more stable over time
* Common in algorithms like DDPG, TD3, SAC

## üîÑ The 3 Processes in Q-learning with Replay

This generalized view helps contextualize where the main and target networks operate:

### **Process 1: Data Collection**

* The agent collects transitions $(s, a, r, s')$ from the environment using a policy $\pi(a|s)$
* These are stored in a **replay buffer**

### **Process 2: Target Network Update**

* Periodically, the parameters of the target network $\phi'$ are updated from the main network $\phi$

### **Process 3: Q-function Regression**

* The main Q-network is trained on batches from the replay buffer using the target network to compute TD targets

Different algorithms manage these processes differently:

* **Online Q-learning**: All 3 processes run at the same speed; no buffer
* **DQN**: Processes 1 and 3 are frequent; process 2 (target update) is slower
* **Fitted Q-Iteration**: Process 3 is nested inside 2, which is nested inside 1 ‚Äî heavy offline training

## üß† Summary Table

| Network                      | How it's updated | How often    | Gradient-based? |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| **Main Q-network** $\phi$    | SGD on TD loss   | Every step   | ‚úÖ Yes           |
| **Target Q-network** $\phi'$ | Hard copy or EMA | Periodically | ‚ùå No            |

## üìå Final Insight

> DQN uses a **two-network system** that closely resembles a **Siamese architecture**: one network learns, while the other provides stable supervision. This architectural idea is what makes deep Q-learning feasible and stable in practice.

Understanding this analogy can help bridge ideas from  contrastive learning and reinforcement learning, especially when exploring more advanced architectures like SimSiam for RL.
