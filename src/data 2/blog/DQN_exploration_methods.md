When training agents with Deep Q-Learning (DQN), exploration is critical — without it, the agent can get stuck exploiting suboptimal behavior. This post compares two widely-used exploration methods: **epsilon-greedy** and **Boltzmann (softmax) exploration**.

## 🎲 Epsilon-Greedy Exploration

### ✅ How it works:

With probability $\varepsilon$, the agent **explores** by choosing a random action. With probability $1 - \varepsilon$, it **exploits** by choosing the best known action.

$$
a =
\begin{cases}
\text{random action} & \text{with probability } \varepsilon \\
\arg\max_a Q(s,a) & \text{with probability } 1 - \varepsilon
\end{cases}
$$

### 🔧 Typical usage:

* $\varepsilon$ starts high (e.g., 1.0) and decays over time
* Encourages exploration early, exploitation later

### Pros:

* Simple to implement
* Robust in many environments

### Cons:

* Uninformed: random exploration ignores Q-values
* Ignores relative quality of suboptimal actions

## 🌡️ Boltzmann (Softmax) Exploration

### ✅ How it works:

Instead of a hard max or random pick, it uses the Q-values to form a **probability distribution** over actions:

```math
P(a \mid s) = \frac{\exp(Q(s,a) / \tau)}{\sum_{a'} \exp(Q(s,a') / \tau)}
```

Where $\tau$ is the temperature:

* High $\tau$: encourages exploration (flatter distribution)
* Low $\tau$: sharpens preference for higher Q-values (close to greedy)

### Pros:

* Smarter exploration: considers relative value between actions
* Smooth transition from exploration to exploitation

### Cons:

* Slightly more complex
* More sensitive to scale of Q-values

| Feature                 | Epsilon-Greedy           | Boltzmann (Softmax)         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Strategy                | Random vs. argmax        | Probabilistic from Q-values |
| Parameter               | $\varepsilon \in [0,1]$  | $\tau > 0$ (temperature)    |
| Uses Q-values?          | ❌ No (for random action) | ✅ Yes                       |
| Simplicity              | ✅ Very simple            | ⚠️ Slightly complex         |
| Control over randomness | Linear decay             | Temperature tuning          |

## 🧠 When to Use What?

* Use **epsilon-greedy** when simplicity is preferred, especially in discrete environments
* Use **Boltzmann** when you want **more informed stochasticity**, especially when Q-values have meaningful structure

In practice, many deep RL implementations start with epsilon-greedy and experiment with softmax exploration as a refinement.
