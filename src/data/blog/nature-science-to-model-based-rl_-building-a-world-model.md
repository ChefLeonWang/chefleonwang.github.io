## Introduction

In both **natural science** and **model-based reinforcement learning (RL)**, the ultimate goal can be framed as **building a world model** — a predictive representation of how the universe or an environment works. This perspective unifies physics, chemistry, biology, and AI into the same conceptual framework.

## 1. The Core Task of Natural Science

Natural science can be thought of as the construction of a **high-precision world model**:

- **State Space**  
  All possible states of the universe — from planetary positions and particle momentum to chemical compositions and biological structures.

- **Transition Model**  
  Physical laws (Newtonian mechanics, Einstein's relativity, quantum mechanics) are essentially $P(s_{t+1} \mid s_t, a_t)$ functions, describing how states evolve.

- **Observation Model**  
  Our senses, telescopes, and instruments are mappings from the true state to measurable signals.

- **Value Function**  
  In science, this might correspond to identifying which predictions or controls help survival, exploration, or progress.

## 2. Why Natural Science is World Modeling

Each scientific discipline builds models at different levels of abstraction:

- **Physics**: Equations approximating universal dynamics.  
- **Chemistry**: Molecular-level reaction modeling.  
- **Biology**: Predictions from cellular to ecosystem scales.  
- **Earth Science**: Climate, earthquakes, and ocean currents.

History of science is an **iterative update process**: older models (e.g., geocentric) are replaced with more accurate ones (e.g., heliocentric).

## 3. Parallels in Model-Based RL

In AI and especially **Model-Based RL**, the process is strikingly similar:

1. **Model the Environment**: Learn a predictive model of state transitions.  
2. **Plan**: Roll out trajectories in the model to explore possible futures.  
3. **Execute**: Choose the optimal policy and apply it in the real environment.  
4. **Update**: Correct the model with new observations.

This mirrors how scientists **develop theories → run simulations → validate with experiments → refine theories**.

## 4. A Unified Framework

Both natural science and model-based RL are about **predict, test, refine**. The key loop:

```text
[ Observe ] → [ Update Model ] → [ Predict Future ] → [ Take Action ] → repeat
```

Where:
- **In Science**: The model is equations & theories.
- **In AI**: The model is neural networks or probabilistic models.

## Conclusion

The **world model** is not just an AI concept — it’s a universal idea. From Newton to deep RL, the essence remains the same:  
> **Understand the rules of the world well enough to predict, and act effectively within it.**

By recognizing this parallel, we can see AI research as a continuation of humanity’s oldest scientific endeavor: **decoding the universe itself**.
