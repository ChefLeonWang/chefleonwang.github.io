# First Principles vs. Heuristics in Machine Learning

## Historical Roots of First Principles

The phrase **first principles** dates back to **Aristotle** (*Metaphysics*, ~350 BC), where he described *archai* (·ºÄœÅœáŒ±ŒØ) ‚Äî the **fundamental causes** from which all reasoning must begin.  
In Latin, this became *prima principia*, and in English: **first principles**.

In modern science:
- **Physics**: First principles = fundamental laws (Newton‚Äôs laws, Schr√∂dinger equation, conservation laws).  
- **Mathematics**: First principles = axioms (Kolmogorov‚Äôs probability axioms, ZFC set theory).  
- **Statistics/ML**: First principles = probabilistic and information-theoretic foundations.

In short: **first principles are the minimal set of assumptions we accept as ‚Äúground truth,‚Äù from which theories are derived**.

## Heuristics: The Other Side of Practice

While first principles provide clarity and universality, **heuristics** are rule-of-thumb methods ‚Äî often ad hoc, but effective in practice.  
- They emerge from **experience, intuition, or engineering needs**, rather than formal derivation.  
- Examples: Dropout, BatchNorm, data augmentation, learning-rate warmup.

Heuristics are not ‚Äúwrong‚Äù; they are **approximations** that work well under uncertainty, when first-principles reasoning is intractable or incomplete.

## First Principles in Machine Learning

Several ML methods can be traced directly to first principles:

- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**  
  Derived from probability axioms; equivalent to minimizing forward KL divergence.  

- **Bayesian Inference**  
  Directly from Bayes‚Äô theorem:  
  $$
  p(\theta|x) \propto p(x|\theta)p(\theta)
  $$ 

- **Maximum Entropy Models (Jaynes, 1955)**  
  The distribution with maximum entropy subject to constraints.  
  Logistic regression and CRFs can be derived this way.  

- **Variational Inference (VI)**  
  Derived from minimizing KL divergence between approximate and true posteriors.  

- **PAC/VC theory**  
  Learning bounds derived from probability theory ‚Äî no heuristics involved.  

These are **clean, axiomatic, and universal** ‚Äî the ‚Äúphysics‚Äù of ML.

## Where Heuristics Dominate

Deep learning in practice relies heavily on heuristics:  

- **Optimization tricks**: Adam, learning rate schedules, gradient clipping.  
- **Regularization**: Dropout, weight decay, data augmentation.  
- **Architecture choices**: kernel size in CNNs, transformer heads, activation functions.  

These choices **cannot be derived from first principles alone**. They are **engineering hacks** ‚Äî found by trial, error, and intuition, but later rationalized.

## The Spectrum: From First Principles to Heuristics

| **Category**             | **Example Algorithms**                      | **Nature** |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Pure First Principles** | MLE, Bayes, MaxEnt, InfoMax                 | Derived directly from probability/information theory |
| **Mixed**                 | VAE (VI is principled, prior choice is heuristic), GANs (JS divergence principled, training tricks heuristic), RL (Bellman eqn principled, exploration heuristic) | Combination |
| **Heuristic-heavy**       | Dropout, BatchNorm, Adam, Transformer scaling laws | Empirical rules |

üëâ Most modern ML lives **in the middle**: principled cores + heuristic scaffolding.

## Why This Distinction Matters

- **First principles** give **theoretical guarantees**, interpretability, and universality.  
- **Heuristics** give **practical efficiency** and robustness to unknowns.  

For example:
- Shannon‚Äôs **channel capacity** theorem = pure first principles.  
- Hamming codes = constructive realization.  
- Dropout = heuristic regularizer, later linked to Bayesian ensemble approximations.  

In ML research, progress often means:  
1. Start with heuristics that work.  
2. Later connect them back to first principles.  
3. Unify into a new formalism.

Machine learning, like physics, is a dance between **first principles** and **heuristics**:  
- Principles give us the laws.  
- Heuristics give us the tools.  
- Together, they allow us to push forward ‚Äî even into the unknown, like asking whether the universe harbors extraterrestrial life.

> ‚ÄúPhysics advances by first principles. Engineering advances by heuristics.  
> Machine learning advances by mixing both.‚Äù ‚Äî *Notes to self*
