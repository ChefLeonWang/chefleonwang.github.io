## Introduction

The **maximum margin principle** is a foundational idea in both supervised learning (e.g., Support Vector Machines) and **Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)**. This post explores the shared geometric intuition, mathematical formulations, and implications of this principle in both domains.

## 1. The Maximum Margin Principle (General Intuition)

> In geometric terms, a *margin* is the distance between a decision boundary (hyperplane) and the closest data points.

In both SVM and IRL, we are:

* Finding a hyperplane that separates (or prefers) one set of data over another.
* Maximizing the *margin* between this hyperplane and competing classes or policies.

## 2. Maximum Margin in Support Vector Machines (SVM)

In SVM, the goal is to separate two classes with the **widest possible margin**. The setup:

Let $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be feature vectors, and $y \in \{+1, -1\}$ be labels.

We define a separating hyperplane:
$H: \quad w^\top x + b = 0$

To maximize the margin, we solve:

$$
\min_{w, b} \quad \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2 \\
\text{s.t.} \quad y_i (w^\top x_i + b) \geq 1 \quad \forall i
$$

This optimization ensures the largest minimum distance from the hyperplane to any data point.

## 3. Maximum Margin in Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)

In **max-margin IRL**, we treat expert behavior as one class, and all other possible policies as another class. Instead of binary labels, we compare expected feature counts:

Let $f(s, a) \in \mathbb{R}^d$ be feature vectors and $\pi^*$ be the expert policy.

We aim to find a reward parameter $\psi \in \mathbb{R}^d$ such that:

$$
\psi^\top \mathbb{E}_{\pi^*}[f(s, a)] \geq \psi^\top \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[f(s, a)] + m, \quad \forall \pi \neq \pi^*
$$

This margin $m$ reflects how much better the expert is under reward $\psi$.

We solve:

$$
\max_{\psi, m} \quad m \\
\text{s.t.} \quad \psi^\top \mathbb{E}_{\pi^*}[f(s,a)] \geq \psi^\top \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[f(s,a)] + m \quad \forall \pi \in \Pi, \quad \|\psi\|_2 \leq 1
$$

This resembles a soft-margin SVM. Geometrically:

* $\psi$ defines a hyperplane in feature space.
* The goal is to push expert trajectories as far as possible from alternatives.

## 4. The Role of the Hyperplane and Constant $c$

In both domains, a hyperplane:

$$
H = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : w^\top x = c\}
$$

splits the space into two regions:

* $H^+ = \{x: w^\top x > c\}$
* $H^- = \{x: w^\top x < c\}$

In IRL, this helps geometrically encode preference over expert policies.

To incorporate bias $c$, many implementations augment features:

$$
f'(s,a) = \begin{bmatrix} f(s,a) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \psi' = \begin{bmatrix} \psi \\ c \end{bmatrix}
$$

Now $\psi'^\top f'(s,a)$ includes the constant offset.
